# FedGrid AI Innovation

A privacy-preserving federated learning platform that enables secure collaboration between energy prosumers while maintaining data privacy and providing auditable records through blockchain-inspired ledger technology.

## Overview

FedGrid AI Innovation is a comprehensive solution that combines federated learning with energy grid optimization. The platform allows prosumers (producers + consumers) to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing sensitive data, while maintaining complete transparency and auditability of all transactions.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React** - Modern UI framework for building interactive dashboards
- **HTML/CSS** - Core web technologies for structure and styling
- **JavaScript** - Dynamic functionality and API interactions

### Backend

- **Node.js** - Server-side JavaScript runtime

### Machine Learning

- **Python** - Primary language for ML operations
- **TensorFlow** - Deep learning framework for model training

## Features

- **Privacy-Preserving**: Federated learning ensures data never leaves local devices
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live updates showing system status and model performance
- **Scalable Architecture**: Cloud-native design supports multiple prosumers
- **Secure API**: RESTful endpoints with proper authentication and validation

## Architecture

The system follows a federated learning architecture where:

1. **Prosumers** train models locally on their data
2. **Model weights** are securely transmitted to the central server
3. **Aggregation** happens on the server without accessing raw data
4. **Updated models** are distributed back to participants
5. **All transactions** are recorded in auditable ledger tables

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- Azure CLI
